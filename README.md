# Wine-Quality-Prediction

# Project Description
Using Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes theorem, state a hypothesis and find out if it holds good or not for a training dataset comprising random 60% of the original data. Compare the result with KNN algorithm for the same sample. Use measures of your choice to show that the class labels arrived at in both techniques are similar or dissimilar. State how you calculated the similarity or dissimilarity of the labels of the two techniques. Additionally, take another 20% random sample, not selected earlier and check by applying one of the two techniques used above to see if what is true for the training sample is also true for the test sample.

The experts have classified the quality of both types of wines, the last column in both datasets gives the quality of the wine. When you test your hypothesis, it may or may not result in the same quality as identified by the experts.
